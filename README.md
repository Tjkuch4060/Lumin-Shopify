## Requirements
- A Shopify store (development or production)
- Shopify CLI (recommended) — https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/cli
- Node.js (only required if using local build tooling)

## Installation

Recommended — Shopify CLI
1. Install Shopify CLI: https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/cli
2. Clone this repo:
   git clone https://github.com/Tjkuch4060/Lumin-Shopify.git
3. Change into the theme directory:
   cd Lumin-Shopify
4. Authenticate and serve locally:
   shopify login --store your-store.myshopify.com
   shopify theme dev
5. When ready to publish or upload:
   shopify theme push --theme <THEME_ID_OR_NAME>

Manual upload (Shopify Admin)
1. Zip the repository contents (include only theme files: layout, templates, sections, snippets, assets, config, locales).
2. In Shopify Admin → Online Store → Themes → Upload theme.
3. Publish or customize from the theme editor.

Theme Kit (legacy)
1. Install Theme Kit: https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/theme-kit
2. Configure config.yml with your store credentials.
3. Upload:
   theme deploy

## Development

Common scripts (add to package.json if you use Node tooling)
- npm run build — run production asset build (CSS/JS)
- npm run watch — watch files and compile during development
- npm run lint — run linters/theme-check
- shopify theme dev — preview directly with Shopify CLI

Recommended additional checks
- theme-check — use Shopify Theme Check to lint Liquid and theme files
- Image optimization and asset minification for production

## Theme structure
- layout/ — theme.liquid and other layout files
- templates/ — templates for pages, products, collections, etc.
- sections/ — customizable sections available in the theme editor
- snippets/ — reusable Liquid partials
- assets/ — CSS, JS, images, fonts
- config/ — settings_schema.json and settings_data.json
- locales/ — translation files

## Customization
- Expose settings in the theme editor by editing config/settings_schema.json
- Add new sections to sections/ and include them in templates
- Create or modify snippets for reusable components
- Use the Shopify theme editor to rearrange and configure sections per page

## Deployment checklist
- Update config/settings_schema.json and settings_data.json for store defaults
- Optimize images and assets (compression, responsive sources)
- Minify CSS/JS if you use a build step
- Run theme-check and any project linters
- Test on multiple devices and browsers, including accessibility checks

## Troubleshooting
- Assets not loading: verify asset paths and that the assets/ folder was uploaded
- Liquid syntax errors: check the Shopify theme editor error messages and CLI logs
- Section not appearing: ensure the section is included in the relevant template and settings
